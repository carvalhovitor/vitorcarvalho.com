Title: Quilo Journal

Text: 

Spanning three hundred pages, Quilo is magazine that blends short stories and visuals from over forty collaborators. Each section is introduced by writers from the respective regions of the country, offering readers a glimpse of Brazilian folklore. The raw layouts were inspired by the language of Brazilian modernist design, while the kraft paper cover connects with a more rustic side of the country.
