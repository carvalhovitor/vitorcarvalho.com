Title: Tolstói & Tolstaia

----

Text: 

This book is composed of three novels: *Sonata Kreutzer*, by Leo Tolstoy; *Who's to Blame?* and *Song without Words *, by Sophia Tolstaya (translated for the first time in Brazil), and a few adjacent texts. The design of the book references visual elements used in musical notation, recognizing music as the starting point and guiding thread of the novels. In the titles, a typography that combines the delicacy of rounded endings with violent sharp serifs alludes to the tempestuous relationship of the Tolstoys.
