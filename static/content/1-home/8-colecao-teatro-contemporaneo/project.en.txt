The Contemporary Theatre Collection is a growing series created by Javali with the goal of publishing affordable paperbacks that celebrates contemporary authors. The theatre script structure was deconstructed into a system that uses two different typefaces, one acting as the passive voice that describes the scenes and the other as what is being spoken by the characters, creating an efficient structure for both conventional readers and rehearsing actors. Each book cover features a different typeface that reflects the book’s content and that permeates the interior whenever possible.
