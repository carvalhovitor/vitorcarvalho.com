Title: Agentes Invisíveis

----

Text: 

The properties of a book’s production process become visual elements in the thesis about the invisible agents of the early Workcenter of Jerzy Grotowski, written by Daniele Sampaio for her master’s degree at UNICAMP. A custom InDesign script was created to automatically insert gradients with different intensities in the spreads’ gutters, activating them throughout the book. Signatures printed on yellow paper stock inserted at the end showcase snippets of important printed matter used during research, available in full on the publisher’s website.
