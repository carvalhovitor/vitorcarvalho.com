Title: Diário Goncourt

----

Text: 

This book presents a selection of entries written by the Goncourt brothers between 1860 and 1896. The visual choices alude to elements of 19th century Paris: metallic structures and boulevards, parks and public works carried out by Haussmann’s renovation program. Internally, the text was structured to emphasize the diary’s singular format, differentiating the Goncourt brothers writing from the organizer’s interventions by using two colors — black and copper.
