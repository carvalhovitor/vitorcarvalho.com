Title: Please Come to the Show

Text: 

Curation and book design for a fictional MoMA catalog of printed invitations from the early 1960s to the present. The pieces that had a strong typographic appeal were selected and categorized into four distinct moments: typewritten, handwritten, serifs and sans-serif—with an enlarged ‘please’ dividing each one of the sections. The cover was screenprinted using a fluorescent red ink, begging for attention.
