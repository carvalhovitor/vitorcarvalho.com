Title: BDMG Cultural

----

Text: 

In the context of BDMG’s Cultural Institute 30th anniversary, this book compiles essays and studies revolving around the city of Belo Horizonte and the state of Minas Gerais. While each article is introduced by a different kind of ruled paper tied to its content, text originally written as footnotes was instead treated as sidenotes, subtly alluding to marginalia. A plastic dust-jacket commonly used on notebooks protects the object produced to be freely distributed.
