Title: Maurício Tizumba

----

Text: 

Maurício Tizumba’s performative character is emphasized in the design of the book that houses Júlia Tizumba's master's thesis. Elastic typography, intense colors and a laid-back positioning of photographs reflect his performance at the crossroads: interdisciplinary and syncretic. Published by Javali.
