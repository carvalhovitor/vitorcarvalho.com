Graphic identity and poster for a play written and directed by Vinícius Souza, featuring two childhood friends who are supposed to rehearse a speech for an award that they might win. The graphic language was imagined as a translation of the oscillating tension the script was built upon, reflecting a crumbling polarized society and the neverending search for a Brazilian identity. The double-sided poster also plays the role of program, highlighting the themes and people involved in the play.
