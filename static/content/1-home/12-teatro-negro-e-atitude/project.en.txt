Title: Teatro Negro e Atitude

----

Text: 

Graphic design of the book "O Teatro Negro e Atitude no Tempo, o Tempo no Teatro Negro e Atitude", written by Evandro Nunes and published by Javali. The graphic elements used throughout the book dialogue with the concept of spiraling time developed by Leda Maria Martins. While the blocked citations highlight the importance of past works for the construction of later narratives, the page numbering and chapter names on an exaggerated scale emphasize the temporal dimension of the publication.
