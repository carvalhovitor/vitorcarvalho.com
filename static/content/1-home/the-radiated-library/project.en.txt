Title: The Radiated Library

----

Text: This project seeks to translate the experiences that defines the medium of the printed book and the physical library into a website. Taking Paul Otlet’s concept of the Radiated Library and what he understood as the social context of documents, the website structure takes clues from the sensorial experiences of navigating through documents in a library and translates them into metaphors of behavior. The site’s foundation is defined around the idea of navigating through notions of scale, time and volume, each defining a different way to experience an entire collection of texts that wouldn’t otherwise be directly related. Each individual document is represented by a shape that symbolizes its transition from paper to screen. The texts were organized into different categories that were assigned to different typefaces, enhancing each category inherit linguistic texture. Instead of opening each text individually, the texts are laid out juxtaposed to one another, creating a cacophony of different verbal and visual expressions.
