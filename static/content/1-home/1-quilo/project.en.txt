Title: Quilo

Text: 

Spanning across three hundred pages, this magazine is an amalgamation of short stories and visuals from over forty collaborators. With each section introduced by writers from their respective region, readers get a glimpse into the folklore of the country. The editorial design and visual language of Quilo captures the essence of the country in the present day; the layouts, inspired by Brazilian Modernist design vernacular, are raw and bold, while the neutral and approachable kraft paper cover speaks to a more rustic side of the country. The typography combines a classic serif and a condensed neo-grotesque with expressive details, creating a feeling that is both contemporary and timeless.
