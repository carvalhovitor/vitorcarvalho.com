Text: 

Written by André Novais de Oliveira, this book kickstarts the publication of film scripts by Javali. A sober solution embraces the specifics of the cinematographic text and seeks to simplify the design of future publications. A system of specific glyphs is used throughout the book to indicate notes that expose a first treatment of the script, inserted on black pages. For this specific book, which has a production diary, the days are graphically indicated by small squares that visually refer to calendars.
