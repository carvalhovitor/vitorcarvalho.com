Title: Teatro Negro e Atitude

----

Text: 

Graphic project for the book ‘O Teatro Negro e Atitude no Tempo, o Tempo no Teatro Negro e Atitude’, written by Evandro Nunes and published by Javali. Playing with the concept of ‘spiraling time’ developed by Leda Maria Martins, a set of high contrast elements provide the book with an intense visual atmosphere. While blocked quotations highlight the importance of past writing in the construction of posterior texts, the exaggerated folios and running footers underline the role that the sequencing of pages play in making the book a temporal experience.
