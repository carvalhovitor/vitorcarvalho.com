Title: The Holocaust

----

Text: 

A type-only pocket-sized paperback book made from a wikipedia article and designed by articulating heaviness and voidness. A series of typographic devices were used to keep the body of text as heavy as possible while maintaining a degree of readability. Quotations inside the text were treated like fading memories and the introduction to each of the chapters fall into the gutter in order to create a slight feel of discomfort.
