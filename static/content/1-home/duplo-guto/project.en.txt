Title: Duplo, Guto

----

Text: 

Identity for a criminal law society working mostly for low-income clients. The logotype was designed by redrawing the letter ‘a’ of an otherwise austere typeface into a custom single-case version. The printed matter dials down the presence of the logotype in favor of a clear presentation of the contact information.

With Júlia Maia and Augusto Brant
