Title: Literatura Mineira

----

Text: 

Commissioned by BDMG’s Cultural Institute, this book celebrates Minas Gerais' literature on the occasion of the state’s 300th anniversary. The two-column structure tackles the space problem created by the large quantity of poems while also referencing the state’s long tradition of literature magazines. The titles were composed in a condensed version of a  typeface used on the early-century modernist magazine A Revista. A serif typeface printed in a metallic spot color used for quotations and poems binds the value of the state’s main source of wealth to its imaterial heritage.
