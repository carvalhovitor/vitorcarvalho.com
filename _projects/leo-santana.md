Website for sculptor Leo Santana, devised to organize his large body of work, spanning from as early as 1987.

A simple yet refined typographic approach was manipulated in order to convey a literary interpretation to Santana’s sculptures&mdash;which consists mostly of commissioned pieces as opposed to self-initiated. Each one of the pages were treated as to suggest the nature of their content: stillness × scale, permanent × ephemeral, etc.
