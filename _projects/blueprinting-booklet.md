title: Blueprinting Booklet
---

A cyanotype-printed booklet explaining the chemistry behind the process. The goal of this project was to interpret and translate a given color into a letter-sized, sixteen-page booklet.

The assigned color being Cyan, the interpretation followed a juxtaposition of a seemingly impenetrable scientific paper on blueprinting written by the chemist <a href="http://www.mikeware.co.uk" target="_blank">Mike&nbsp;Ware</a> and the printing process&rsquo; itself by handprinting the entire booklet in Cyanotype.

<p class="specifications">8½ × 11", 16-page signature printed in Cyanotype</p>
