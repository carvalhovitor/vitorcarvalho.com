title: Digital Postcards
---

A series of postcards conceived to emphasize the relationship between analog and contemporary digital tools as a working methodology.

A collection of forty french postcards from the 19th century were overprinted using fluorescent blue ink as a metaphor for the screen, giving new meaning to a set of objects that already had their previous lives expired.
