Bilingual editorial project for brazilian sculptress Vânia Braga with photography by Rui Alves.

Braga&rsquo;s work consists of creating animals—mostly felines—sculpted in real life sizes. The book&rsquo;s main motif uses diagonals within a grid to move small boxes of text, enabling a dynamic experience and establishing a dialog between the book&rsquo;s structure and the sculptress&rsquo; work. The introduction to each of the book&rsquo;s sections shows an oversized cut-out number to mirror the sculptures curvilinear quality.
