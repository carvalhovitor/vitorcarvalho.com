Website design and development for Brazilian visual artist Leo Santana, devised to organize his large body of work, spanning from as early as 1987.

A simple yet refined typographic approach conveys a literary feeling to Santana’s work, which consists mostly of commissioned public pieces. Each one of the main pages were treated as to suggest the nature of their content: stillness, scale, permanence, ephemerality etc.

The website was updated in 2017 to include a CMS and an online store that aims to sell some of Santana’s small and medium scale pieces to potential collectors.
