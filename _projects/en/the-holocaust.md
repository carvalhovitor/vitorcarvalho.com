A type-only pocket-sized paperback book made from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust" target="_blank">wikipedia article</a> and designed by articulating heaviness and voidness.

A series of typographic devices were used to keep the body of text as heavy as possible while maintaining a degree of readability. Quotations inside the text were treated like fading memories and the introduction to each of the chapters fall into the gutter in order to create a slight feel of discomfort.
