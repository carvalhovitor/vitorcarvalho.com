Poster for an upcoming documentary movie about the life of the Brazilian inventor. Intended for raising funds from potential investors, the poster/information sheet was designed with two typographic voices, juxtaposing a documental tone with a more personal and poetic one. The sheet unfolds to reveal more information about the movie, images and upcoming relevant dates—typographically treated as newspaper headlines. The back contains a blown-out photograph of moments before Santos-Dumont flew his first invention, the Brasil balloon, dated 1898.
