title: Contemporary Theatre Collection
---

The Contemporary Theatre Collection is a growing series created by the publishing house Javali with the goal of publishing affordable paperbacks that celebrates contemporary authors.

The very specific theatre script structure was broken down into a system that uses two different typefaces, one acting as the passive voice that describes the scenes and the other as what is being spoken by the characters, creating an efficient structure for both conventional readers and rehearsing actors.

Keeping the red as the series brand, each book cover features a different typeface that reflects the book’s content and that permeates the interior whenever possible. For the first book in the series, Trilogia Abnegação by Alexandre Dal Farra, an obnoxious stacked all-caps Akzidenz-Grotesk echoes the author’s simple but rather strong use of language.
