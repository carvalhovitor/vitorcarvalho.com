A cyanotype-printed booklet explaining the scientific process behind blueprinting. The goal of this project was to interpret and translate a given color into a letter-sized, sixteen-page booklet. The assigned color was Cyan and the interpretation was materialized through the juxtaposition of a seemingly impenetrable scientific paper on blueprinting and the printing process’ itself by handprinting the entire booklet in Cyanotype.
