title: Duplo, Guto
order: 13

The first release by Guto, Duplo is an EP constructed around discussions of the duality of identity as an inherent aspect of human condition. 

The packaging for the 10&quot; vinyl disc features a neon sign photographed on a typical dry grass scenario. The photograph was reproduced with a three color process to replicate the oneiric atmosphere of the real setting.

The back cover lists the lyrics with a dense typographic configuration purposefully arranged besides empty columns; the word play on each of the songs is suggested through an collection of invented glyphs and diacritics.
