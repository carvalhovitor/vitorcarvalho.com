The second <a href="https://vitorcarvalho.net/#contemporary-theatre-collection" target="_blank">Contemporary Theatre Collection</a> book published by Javali, Farinha com Açúcar (Ou Sobre a Sustança de Meninos e Homens) is a play written by Jé Oliveira as a tribute to Racionais MC’s, arguably São Paulo’s most influential rap group.

Following the collection’s previously designed structure, the gothic typeface used on the cover and occasionally throughout the book paraphrases Racionais MC’s visual identity. The play beginning and ending are marked by symbols commonly used to indicate one’s year of birth and year of death, reinforcing the text’s structure based on two acts&mdash;from death to life.
