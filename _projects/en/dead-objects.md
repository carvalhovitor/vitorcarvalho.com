title: Dead Objects
order: 10

A project meant to explore objects partially devoid of their original meaning. Artifacts were collected and documented between October 16th and January 23rd (2017&ndash;2018), resulting in a series of one hundred photographs. The project's website was designed and developed to showcase each object individually, creating a tongue-in-cheek atmosphere of an art gallery that is reaffirmed by it's use of white space and a black-only hanging grotesque typeface. A comprehensive index alphabetically or numerically sorted serves as the website's main navigation.
