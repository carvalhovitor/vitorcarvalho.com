title: Please Come to the&nbsp;Show
---

The goal for this project was to curate a selection of MoMA&rsquo;s invites and create a collective meaning by turning them into a printed book. The invites that had a strong typographic appeal were selected in order to divide the book into four moments: typewritten, handwritten, serifs and sans-serifs&mdash;using the word &ldquo;please&rdquo; to create a pause between each section. The cover was screenprinted using a fluorescent red ink as to convey the idea of wanting attention.
