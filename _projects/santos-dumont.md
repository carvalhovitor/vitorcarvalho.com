title: Santos-Dumont
---

Santos-Dumont is an upcoming documentary movie about the life of the homonymous Brazilian inventor.

In order to raise funds from potential investors, a poster / information sheet was designed with two typographic voices, juxtaposing a documental tone with a more personal and poetic one. The folded sheet was distributed inside plastic bags to underline the historical-documental nature of the movie and the poster itself. The sheet unfolds to reveal more information about the movie, images and upcoming relevant dates—typographically treated as newspaper headlines. The back contains a blown-out photograph of moments before Santos-Dumont flew his first invention, the Brasil balloon, dated 1898.
